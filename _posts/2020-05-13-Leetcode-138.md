## Problem 
138. Copy List with Random Pointer
https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/

## Notes
- Replicate the list without the random pointer. 1->2->3 becomes 1->1 clone->2->2 clone->3->3 clone
- Traverse through the newly created list. For each original node, find out where the random pointer points to, update the clone's random pointer to original.random.next. 
- Be sure to separate the clones from the originals before returning the results. 

## Code  
```java
{% raw %}
class Solution {
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return head; 
        replicate(head); 
        Node ans = head.next; 
        Node curr = head; 
        while (curr != null) {
            Node originNext = curr.next.next; 
            if (originNext != null) curr.next.next = curr.next.next.next; 
            curr.next = originNext;
                
            curr = originNext; 
        }
        return ans; 
    }
    
    private void replicate(Node head) {
        Node dummy = new Node(0);
        Node prev = dummy; 
        Node curr = head; 
        while (curr != null) {
            Node temp = curr.next;
            Node rep = new Node(curr.val); 
            prev.next = curr; 
            curr.next = rep;
            prev = rep; 
            curr = temp; 
        }
        
        curr = head; 
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.random != null) curr.next.random = curr.random.next; 
            curr = curr.next.next; 
        }
    }
}
{% endraw %}
```
