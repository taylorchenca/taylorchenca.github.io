## Thoughts on Leetcode 

### You do not need special talent to succeed at Leetcode
Of course, there are people who are naturally good at this than others. But you don't need to be that good to pass a medium-level coding interview. If getting a tech job is something that matters to you, just keep your head down and do Leetcode.  

Feel like you are always getting stuck and want to review your CS fundamentals. Just look up online courses on algorithms and data structures. You don't need more CS than that for Leetcode. 

### Start early, start often 
When you go to a job interview, confidence is important. Confidence comes from preparedness. If you plan on going to a coding interview any time in the next 6 months, now is probably a good time to start.  

Do problems. Do a lot of them. That's how you'll gain confidence. 

### Keep a journal of your problem-solving
Even if your writeup is not as good as those posts getting high number of votes in the discussion, you should still keep a journal keeping track of your thinking for each problem.
  
Writing your problem solving process down forces you to check your understanding. If the code is copied from other people's solution, now is the chance to see if you really do understand.  

At some point, you might want to review your solution to problems you have solved. Your journal will be your best reference. Your writing is what makes the most sense to you.
